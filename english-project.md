## 2. Introduction
Child labour deprives millions of Indian children of their childhood, education, and future prospects. Anees Jung’s ‘Lost Spring’ (Flamingo, NCERT) draws readers to the stark realities faced by children forced into labour, framing an urgent need to assess how education can break this cycle of exploitation. This extended report will provide a deeper insight into child labour statistics, real-life cases, the role of education, relevant laws, and broad-based social remedies.

---

## 3. Background & About Anees Jung

Her works explore the lives of minorities and those affected by poverty, injustice, and social exclusion, including 'Lost Spring,' which vividly examines stolen childhoods due to child labour ([25][31][34][35][36]).

---

## 4. Objectives of the Study

- To investigate the impact of education on child labour prevention and elimination.
- To analyze legislative and social interventions in India.

---

## 6. Detailed Analysis of 'Lost Spring'
- **Saheb-e-Alam:** Migrant ragpicker from Dhaka, dreams of school but is forced to work in Seemapuri, Delhi. Loss of freedom and hope upon entering wage labour ([26][31][32]).
- **Mukesh:** Born to glass bangle makers of Firozabad. Lives and works in hazardous conditions but aspires to break family tradition by becoming a motor mechanic. Represents resistance, ambition, and hope ([26][29][32]).
- **Themes:** Exploitation, lost childhood, poverty, fatalism, and the redemptive role of education.

---

## 7. Child Labour in India: Facts, Statistics & Root Causes

- India’s child labour population in 2025 is projected at 74.3 lakh (7.43 million), with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra accounting for half of all cases ([14][20][23]).
- Close to 50,000 children under 14 years are employed in Firozabad’s glass industry, with hazardous and unregulated working conditions ([33]).
- Key drivers: poverty, lack of educational access, family debt, caste, and migration ([14][20][21][33]).
- National Sample Survey (2017-18): Over 3 crore out-of-school children, increasing vulnerability to labour ([24]).

---

## 8. Case Studies & Real-life Examples

**Saheb’s Story (Seemapuri, Delhi):** Ragpicking as sole survival means. Despite his urge to attend school, poverty and lack of social support trap him in labour.
**Mukesh’s Story (Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh):** Glass bangle industry hazardous for children; work passed down as caste tradition. Mukesh’s aspirations embody hope for change ([26][29][33][30]).
**Glass Industry, Firozabad:** About 50,000 children engaged; cycle tied to poverty, caste, and lack of alternatives. NGOs and local government interventions have achieved rehabilitation via bridge schooling and vocational training ([33][30]).

---

## 9. Legal Framework & Government Initiatives

- **The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009:** Guarantees free education for 6–14-year-olds; mandates non-employment during school years ([15][21]).
- **Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:** Bans employment under 14 in all occupations; prohibits hazardous work for 14–18-year-olds ([15][20]).
- **National Policy on Child Labour, 1987:** Combines legal action, welfare, and awareness campaigns ([15][21]).
- **Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:** Rehabilitation framework for exploited children ([15]).
- **National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme:** Rescues, rehabilitates, and mainstreams children through education and bridge courses ([18][21][22]).

---

## 10. Education: Impact, Barriers and Role in Child Labour Elimination

**Impact:**
- Education reduces vulnerability to exploitation; empowers with skills, rights awareness, and pathways to better livelihoods ([16][22]).
- Schooling improves self-esteem, health outcomes, and breaks cycles of poverty ([16][22]).

**Barriers:**
- Lack of schools and infrastructure—especially rural areas.
- Economic necessity within families.
- Cultural resistance and societal apathy.
- Poor implementation and monitoring of education and welfare schemes ([21][22]).

**Role in Elimination:**
- Keeps children out of labour markets.
- Raises societal awareness to prioritize childhood.
- Reintegration through bridge courses and vocational training for older adolescents (NCLP, Skill India, PMKVY) ([18][21]).

## 12. Role of NGOs and Community Programs
- NGOs like Bal Raksha Bharat (Save the Children), Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, CRY, and others rescue children, run bridge schools, spread awareness, counsel families, and lobby for legal reform ([16][19][24][30]).
- Community-level initiatives like school adoption, mothers’ self-help groups, and vocational training for parents and siblings are integral ([30]).
- National campaigns have mainstreamed thousands of rescued child labourers into formal education ([16][22][24]).

---

## 13. International Perspective & India’s Progress
- Globally in 2024, 138 million children engaged in labour; 54 million in hazardous work. India accounts for 10–13 million child labourers ([17][23]).
- SDG Target 8.7, aiming for elimination by 2025, not met due to slow progress ([17][23]).
- India’s reduction rate has slowed; accelerated efforts needed (awareness, budget, stricter enforcement) ([14][20][23]).

---

## 14. Suggestions & Recommendations
- Enhance enforcement of child labour and education laws, clarifying legal definitions ([20]).
- Investment in educational infrastructure, especially rural and high-incidence states ([14][15][22][24]).
- Vocational education for adolescents and children rescued from labour ([18][30]).
- Incentives (mid-day meals, scholarships) for poor families to send children to school ([21]).
- Community engagement and targeted awareness to shift mindsets ([16][19]).
- Collaboration between government, NGOs, local communities, law enforcement, and industry ([30]).

---

## 15. Conclusion
Anees Jung’s ‘Lost Spring’ brings forth the human dimension of child labour, illuminating the need for radical social transformation. Education stands as the single most powerful and sustainable tool for the prevention and elimination of child labour. Coordinated efforts—combining policy, enforcement, community, and compassion—can secure every child’s right to a safe, educated, and hopeful childhood.
