## 2. Introduction
**Child labour** remains a grave social issue in India and many developing countries, depriving millions of children of their childhood, education, and a dignified life.
Anees Jung’s ‘Lost Spring’ highlights the plight of children forced into labour, particularly in hazardous industries like rag-picking and glass making. The chapter compels us to examine the vicious cycle of poverty and illiteracy, exploring how education can act as a powerful tool to prevent and eventually eliminate child labour.

---

## 3. Objectives of the Study
- To understand the depiction of child labour in ‘Lost Spring’
- To investigate the causes behind child labour and its persistence
- To assess how education can prevent and eliminate child labour
- To evaluate the impact of education on the lives of vulnerable children
- To review government and non-governmental initiatives in promoting child rights

---

## 4. Research Methodology
- **Textual analysis** of ‘Lost Spring’ by Anees Jung from Flamingo
- **Collection of data** through secondary sources (articles, reports, online databases)
- **Real-life case studies** from India and around the world
- Analysis of **government reports, legal acts, and NGO efforts** concerning child labour

## 5. Theoretical Background (Based on 'Lost Spring')

Anees Jung’s ‘Lost Spring’ is an evocative account that presents the stories of two young boys, Saheb and Mukesh, who are victims of child labour in India. The chapter is divided into two poignant narratives:

**Part I: Saheb-e-Alam**
Saheb is a ragpicker who migrated from Dhaka to Seemapuri, Delhi, with his family in hope of a better life. The narrative portrays his struggle for a livelihood, as he scours garbage dumps daily to support his family. Despite his enthusiasm and longing for school, the harsh reality of poverty and the systemic failure to provide free education keep him confined to a life of deprivation. His search for coins and bits of metal becomes a metaphor for lost childhood and dreams. Anees Jung highlights how the lack of education not only perpetuates the cycle of poverty but also diminishes hope, as Saheb exchanges his independence for meagre wages.

**Part II: Mukesh**
Mukesh belongs to the family of glass bangle makers in Firozabad, a trade passed down for generations. The story exposes the hazardous working conditions and health risks faced by children in the industry. Mukesh’s family, trapped in a web of poverty, traditions, and middlemen, is resigned to their fate; however, Mukesh stands out with his persistent dream of becoming a motor mechanic. Jung’s narrative demonstrates the psychological and physical toll child labour takes on children and their families, and how the yearning for education and a different life persists even in the bleakest circumstances.

Throughout ‘Lost Spring’, Anees Jung employs vivid imagery and personal interviews to underline the loss of innocence, resilience in adversity, and the need for social change. The chapter is both a literary and social commentary, urging readers and policymakers to recognize the urgent need for educational opportunities as the primary solution to end child labour and restore childhood dreams.

## 6. Case Studies & Real-life Examples
### Case 1:
**Saheb– the Rag Picker (Lost Spring):** He dreams of going to school but is instead forced to scavenge for survival.

### Case 2:
**Carpet Weaving Child in Varanasi:** Many children in Varanasi’s carpet industry miss out on schooling due to the economic needs of their families.

### Case 3:
**Bachpan Bachao Andolan Success Story:** Through intervention, thousands of child labourers have been rescued and reintegrated into formal education, breaking the victimization cycle.

---

## 7. Analysis: Role of Education in Preventing Child Labour
**Education functions as both a shield and a sword**:
- It equips children with knowledge, critical thinking, and skills, making them less likely to be exploited.
- Educated children are more aware of their rights and less likely to be manipulated into exploitative labour.
- Schooling offers children a structured environment that keeps them away from hazardous work.
- Families with educated parents value formal education more, reducing the tendency to send children to work.

## 8. Impact of Education on Children and Society
| Impact Area                | Without Education                        | With Education                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Economic                   | Perpetuates poverty                      | Improves job prospects, raised incomes        |
| Health                     | Prone to illness, injury                 | Better health and hygiene awareness           |
| Social Mobility            | Trapped in unskilled/labour roles        | Enhanced upward mobility                      |
| Self-esteem                | Low due to exploitation                  | Boosted through achievements                  |
| National Development       | Hinders growth, increases dependency     | Develops skilled workforce, boosts GDP        |

## 9. Government Policies, Laws, and Initiatives
- **The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), 2009:** Ensures free elementary education for children aged 6 to 14 years.
- **Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 & 2016 Amendment:** Prohibits child labour below 14 years.
- **Mid-day Meal Scheme:** Improves child nutrition and incentivizes attendance.
- **Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan:** Universalizes elementary education in India.
- **Anganwadi Centres and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Provide informal education and care for marginalized children.

---

## 10. Suggestions and Recommendations
- Strengthen enforcement of child labour laws.
- Incentivize poor families to send children to school (scholarships, mid-day meals).
- Raise awareness among communities of the long-term benefits of education.
- Encourage industry accountability to eliminate child labour from supply chains.
- Increase collaboration between government agencies and NGOs.

---

## 11. Conclusion
Anees Jung’s ‘Lost Spring’ puts a human face on the statistics of child labour. It is evident that **education is pivotal** in preventing child labour and empowering children to lead fulfilling lives. Collective efforts by the government, civil society, and individuals are required to secure the right to education for every child, setting them free from the shackles of child labour.
